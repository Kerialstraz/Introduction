# Introduction

Hello fellow soul who lost their track and found my profile.
I'm new to the world of programming, in fact I haven't even finished my C++ introduction book.
Im here to look at the code from others in order to learn how to structure a real program, because 
thats currently my biggest problem. I don't know how and where to start.
